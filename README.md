# iottly-client-UI
The *iottly-client-UI* repo hosts the html and js files for the iottly client frontend:
- files are served by the [iottly-client-core](https://github.com/iottly/iottly-client-core) service;
- it connects to the [iottly-client-core](https://github.com/iottly/iottly-client-core) service via websockets to receives messages in real-time.

It can be used as a starting point to develop custom user interfaces based on Iottly, where messages coming in from devices needs to be pushed by Iottly to the custom client application.


# Setup instructions

Please refer to [Iottly docker](https://github.com/iottly/iottly-docker) for prerequisites and full Iottly setup.
